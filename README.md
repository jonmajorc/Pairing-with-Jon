# Pairing With Jon

This repository is where awesome pair programming activities with awesome people, like yourself, are tracked!

**FYI** -- _This is a start to hopefully something fun and excting that is kept around. I am trying something new here and that is pairing with random people, like yourself. I want to have the ability when we are all said and done pairing, we can refer to eachother as friends! -- not Twitter, Slack, Instagram, Pinterest, or what have you "friends"._

_[Hi, thanks for reaching out to me.](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/hi-thanks-for-reaching-out-to-me-d970e7e6632) (Please read before creating an issue to pair)_ ðŸ‘‹

## [Ask to pair](https://github.com/jonmajorc/Pairing-with-Jon/issues/new)

Guidelines:

- If you know what you want to pair on, use a succinct title and description.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
- I will not help pair program anything that goes against my personal moral standards.
- I will not pair program your homework. ðŸ“–

Please be patient if I don't respond to you right away! You can always reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jonmajorc)

Lastly, if you have any cool ideas for this repository -- create an issue to let me me know!
